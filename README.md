# hello-world
My first GitHub repository
I am a not-too-smart smart guy with too much time on his hands and no one to spend it with.
I am struggling to find my footing in the programming world again as I venture back to coding
after a decade-and-a-half away from the console. All the IDEs and frameworks are different now
and I feel overwhelmed. BTW, I've had tacos on the moon and on the Earth and I prefer moon
tacos.
